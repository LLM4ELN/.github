## 📖 Description

We are excited to invite you to the **3-day online LLM4ELN Hackathon**, dedicated to exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) systems for all scientific disciplines. 

Join us to learn how to transform unstructured laboratory data into structured, actionable knowledge using cutting-edge LLM technologies—from automated data extraction to intelligent reporting and analysis.

## ⚠️ Minimum Requirements

This hackathon emphasizes **prototype development**. To ensure effective collaboration, participants should have the following competencies:

- ✅ Proficiency in **Python** and **Git**
- ✅ Familiarity with the **OpenAI API** and access to an API (e.g., Google Gemini, ChatAI of GWDG, Blablador of FZ Jülich)
- ✅ Basic understanding of **LangChain**
- ✅ API or code-level access to an **ELN**

> 📝 A short self-evaluation form is provided to confirm readiness.
